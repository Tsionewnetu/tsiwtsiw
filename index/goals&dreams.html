    <h2>My Goals & Dreams</h2>
    <p>I want to be a doctor ,specifically a cardiologist. In my country, Ethiopia there are many children who need medical care my dream is to help these children by becoming a doctor and eventually building my own hospital called Albatross Hospital.

    <h2>Medical Fields That Interest Me</h2>
    <p>My main goal is to become a cardiologist , but after watching the movie <b>Heartbeat</b>, I realized how exciting and meaningful emergency medicine is . If I ever find my self more passionate about emergency care, I might choose to join an emergency medical team in the future.  </p>

    <h2>Social Issues I Care About</h2>

    <p>I was watching a podcast called <b>Hakim</b>(Doctor), where a gynecologist shared something that really made me think. In Ethiopia, medical students study for 7-8 years, then work in government hospitals for 2 years before they can specialized. This doctor shared her experiance during her third year of specializiation, she was pregnant. After giving birth, she was only given one month to rest. If she needed more time, she had to repeat the entire year! </p>
  <p>This rule does not make sense to me. Giving birth is a natural and beautiful part of life. Women should not be ashamed or penalized for becoming mothers. Instead, they should be supported and encouraged. A mother is bringing new life into the world that means a lot! I want to change this system so women in the medical field get fair maternity leave without losing a whole year of their studies. </p>
